At Dainton Copse your children will develop an appreciation and knowledge of the natural environment through all four seasons. They will have loads of fun making wonderful memories and learning to respect and care for our environment. They will take part in woodland crafts, campfire songs, marshmallow toasting, hot chocolate drinking and, of course, have lots of time for free play.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://dcforestschool.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dcforestschool.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Contact Phone Sara - number Email email
