Originating from Scandinavia, forest school uses the woodland setting as both a classroom and a playground. The child-led philosophy encourages children to be resilient, independent and confident learners. Research has shown that spending time outdoors has a positive effect on children’s mental health, too: children tend to have better focus and are less anxious if they spend more time in nature.</description></item><item><title>Community</title><link>https://dcforestschool.github.io/community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dcforestschool.github.io/community/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://dcforestschool.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dcforestschool.github.io/contact/</guid><description>Contact Phone Sara - number Email email

She was lucky to have an ‘outdoorsy’ childhood and loves to share her passion for the outdoors with the visitors that come to the woodland.
Knowing that our children are the future caretakers of our planet motivates her to support young people in fostering positive relationships with our wonderful natural world.</description></item></channel></rss>
