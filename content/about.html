<h1 id="about-us">About us</h1>
<h3 id="about-overview"> Using a Forest School approach, Dainton Copse Forest School CIC runs nature-based activities for children and their families in our beautiful woodland environment.</h3>
<p>At Dainton Copse your children will develop an appreciation and knowledge of the natural environment through all four seasons. They will have loads of fun making wonderful memories and  learning to respect and care for our environment. They will take part in woodland crafts, campfire songs, marshmallow toasting, hot chocolate drinking and, of course, have lots of time for free play. In our woodland there are quiet places to sit, watch and listen, spaces to chat with friends, areas to spark creativity and imagination, things to question, things to count, sensory experiences to investigate and places to explore reading and writing.

<p>Forest School has an important role to play in connecting children to nature as we strive towards a sustainable future for all. Research in the UK into Forest School and its effects on young children has found positive impacts in terms of:
</p>
<p>Confidence</p>
<p>Social skills</p>
<p>Language and Communication</p>
<p>Motivation and Concentration</p>
<p>Physical skills</p>
<p>Knowledge and Understanding</p>

<br></br>
<p>It is not just our young people who will benefit though: we are seeing an increasing understanding of how green spaces can aid the mental health of everyone. Being among trees, whatever your age, has been found to reduce stress and improve mood, helping to keep mental health issues at bay or improve them. Spending time in natural surroundings can also help people feel more connected to nature, which has been found to encourage pro-environmental behaviour.
