<h1 id="about-us">About us</h1>
<h3 id="about-overview"> Using a Forest School approach, Dainton Copse Forest School CIC runs nature-based activities for children and their families in our beautiful woodland environment.</h3>
<br></br>
<p>Originating from Scandinavia, forest school uses the woodland setting as both a classroom and a playground. 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>The child-led philosophy encourages children to be <b>resilient</b>, <b>independent</b> and <b>confident learners</b>. 
Research has shown that spending time outdoors has a <b>positive effect on children’s mental health</b>, too: children tend to have <b>better focus</b> and are <b>less anxious</b> if they spend more time in nature.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>The increase in outdoor activity also has a <b>positive physical impact</b>. They are <b>physically stronger</b>, <b>more agile</b> and <b>sleep better</b> at night. Additionally, outdoor play <b>develops children's balance</b>, <b>climbing</b> and <b>sensory skills</b>.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>If you’re keen for your child to grow in confidence, resilience, and <b>develop a lifelong love of the outdoors</b>, forest school is a brilliant option!</p>
<br></br>
<p>It is not just our young people who will benefit though: we are seeing an increasing understanding of how green spaces can aid the mental health of everyone. Being among trees, whatever your age, has been found to reduce stress and improve mood, helping to keep mental health issues at bay or improve them. Spending time in natural surroundings can also help people feel more connected to nature, which has been found to encourage pro-environmental behaviour.
